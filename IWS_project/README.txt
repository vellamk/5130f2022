We are trying to develop a social media web application that would eliminate fake profiles and bots. 
This has been inspired from the 'Elon Musk' Twitter buy out situation where he estimated that Twitter has 11% of bots users which kills the user expereince and authentic interest in the app
We are trying to eliminate or reduce the number of bots a social media appliaction has by launching a web application which ties your account to some sort of identity. 

For instance, a user who needs to login to the app has to submit some sort of identity to prove that he is a legitimate user. It could be a "Drivers License, Student ID, Employment ID, Passport, Bank Statements. 
This would link your account to your ID which proves the user who has logged in is a legitimate user trying to have the best experience. 


Technologies we would be using to develop this are HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDb. These technologies would help us develop a webpage and have some sort of databse connectivity to take inputs from the users and map their identities.
