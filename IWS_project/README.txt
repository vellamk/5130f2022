We are trying to develop a social media web application that would eliminate fake profiles and bots. 
I got the base idea when I saw fake messages from spam accounts on WhatsApp, Facebook, and other social media applications and sites. These accounts spead fake or biased information to acheive their desire or looting innocent people's money. 
For this project I would like to study how gmail segregates spam emails from normal emails and have a separate folder for them and try to implement same rules in this application.
If possible I would even like to implement something like "report" to these messages which will stop others(who are not spamers) from sharing these messages, as many of the spam messages will be so appealing to forward in other groups.
Overall, I would like to work on reducing fake messages and profiles along side working on stopping the spam messages or atlest warn the reader about these messages. In order to do this, I need to understand how gmail avoids the spam emails and further note the points where gmail and other major digital platforms are failing to stop these.
